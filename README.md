## Activation

You can specify how you want the extension to activate by setting the parameter `perforce.activationMode`

* `always` - Always try to activate the extension (old behavior)
* `autodetect` - Only activate when detecting a valid depot or `.p4config` file (default)
* `off` - Don't try to activate

The following can be set in VSCode user or workspace settings to properly detect the perforce depot
```json
{
    "perforce.user": "your_user",
    "perforce.client": "your_client",
    "perforce.port": "example.com:1666"
}
```

You can also create a `.p4config` file at the root of your workspace with perforce variables
```
P4USER=your_user
P4CLIENT=your_client
P4PORT=example.com:1666
```
More detail in [Perforce Documentation](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/r17.1/manuals/cmdref/index.html#CmdRef/P4CONFIG.html?Highlight=p4config)

## Multi-root support

You can now specify the following settings per workspace:
* `perforce.client`
* `perforce.user`
* `perforce.port`
* `perforce.password`
* `perforce.dir`

This allows you to work with different repository within the same editor.
See [Multi-root Workspaces - Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_settings) for more details.
